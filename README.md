# Laravel Bank Hols
An app to introduce and experiment with concepts introduced at PHPUK 24, such as Livewire and Dagger.

Functionally, the aim of this application is for the following:
- A command to import bank holidays from https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays.json and store them in a database
- A UI to allow these to be viewed upon being loaded from the database
